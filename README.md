# Project Title

üì± The app goes by the name (Tip Split) - [[(https://tip-split.vercel.app/)]](https://tip-split.vercel.app/). 

This is a React application that can be useful to anyone who frequently goes out to eat or dines at üå≠üåÆüçîüçïüåØüçΩÔ∏è restaurants and wants to easily split the üßæ bill and calculate the tip amount among a group of people. It eliminates the need for manual calculations or relying on a calculator app, and makes it easy to adjust the bill üíµ ü™ô and tip amount as well as the number of people splitting the bill. This can save time and reduce the potential for math errors, making it a convenient tool for both personal and group use. Additionally, this app can be useful for any business that looking to help their customers to split the bill and calculate the tip.

This application makes use of several state variables, including "bill," "tip," "split," "splitTotal," "tipPerPerson," and "totalBill." The useState() hook is used to manage these variables in the functional component. The app has multiple sections, including a top section for inputting the bill and tip amount, a middle section for adjusting the number of people to split the bill with, and a bottom section that displays the calculated split total, tip per person, and total bill amount. The code also includes several functions for handling input changes, incrementing and decrementing the split value, and calculating various totals based on the inputted bill and tip amount and the number of people splitting the bill. Nonethelss, app also uses the chakra-ui library for styling.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
